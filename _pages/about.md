I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Software Engineering at the University of Calgary. Before, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [DASLab](https://das.encs.concordia.ca/) in the department of computer science and software engineering at Concordia University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from Concordia University under Dr. Emad Shihab supervision. I obtained my masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). My research interests cover a wide range of software engineering related topics including software bots, chatbots, software quality, and mining software repositories.
